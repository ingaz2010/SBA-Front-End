<h1>PRE-K</h1>
<h3>(4 years old)</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the 4-K Program at Brainorama, where we provide a stimulating and
    nurturing environment for children aged 4 years, preparing them for a smooth
    transition into kindergarten and laying a solid foundation for lifelong
    learning. Our program is designed to foster curiosity, creativity,
    social-emotional development, and academic readiness through engaging
    activities and supportive interactions.</p>

<h3>Experienced and Dedicated Educators</h3>
<p>
    Our 4-K Program is led by experienced educators who are passionate about
    early childhood education. They create a positive and inclusive atmosphere
    where every child feels valued and supported in their learning journey. Our
    teachers are committed to providing personalized attention and fostering a love
    for learning in each child.</p>

<h3>Safe and Stimulating Learning Environment</h3>
<p>
    Safety is our utmost priority. Our classrooms are carefully designed with
    age-appropriate materials, learning centers, and comfortable spaces that
    promote exploration and discovery. We maintain high standards of cleanliness
    and hygiene to ensure a healthy environment where children can learn, play,
    and grow.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Curriculum</h3>
<p>
    Our curriculum is thoughtfully designed to support all areas of development.
    We integrate play-based learning with structured activities that promote
    language and literacy skills, mathematical thinking, scientific exploration,
    creative arts, and social studies. Children engage in hands-on experiences
    that encourage critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration.</p>

<h3>Daily Schedule and Activities</h3>
<p>
    Our daily schedule includes a balance of teacher-led activities, small group
    work, independent exploration, and outdoor play. Activities such as circle
    time, storytelling, music and movement, art projects, and sensory play enrich
    childrenâ€™s learning experiences and support their cognitive, social, and
    emotional development.</p>

<h3>Preparation for Kindergarten</h3>
<p>
    The 4-K Program focuses on preparing children for a successful transition to
    kindergarten. We emphasize important skills such as phonemic awareness,
    letter recognition, counting, number sense, fine and gross motor skills,
    self-regulation, and social interaction. Our educators provide differentiated
    instruction to meet the needs of each child and ensure readiness for the next
    educational milestone.</p>
